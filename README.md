myLinkedIn-Connections-App
==========================

This is an app to fetch LinkedIn connections for an authenticated LinkedIn User.

 - My app has a screen with a button "Sign in with LinkedIn".
 - On clicking that button, it will call LinkedIn OAUTH, and asks us to enter UserName/Password.
 - Once its authenticated, gives another button "Get Connections".
 - Once connections are fetched, it shows grid of connections name with profile pic.
